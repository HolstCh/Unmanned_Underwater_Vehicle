# Unmanned Underwater Vehicle

## Project Overview
This research project involves designing and implementing a software/hardware integration to provide underwater drone control for Unmanned Vehicles Robotarium research lab. Our team successfully integrated various electronic components and developed software to control the underwater drone. We had developed a GUI using Python that is capable of communicating with a Raspberry Pi and PX4 flight controller to send commands and read movement data. The project consists of a custom GUI, a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B, Pixhawk 4 autopilot, a drone prototype, and a list of other various electronic components. The projectâ€™s main objective is deploying and navigating the drone prototype within confined underwater spaces.

## Software System

<img src="images/software_architecture.jpg" alt="Alt Text" width="1000" height="700"/>

- **Model**: contains logic, calculations, and direct command communication with the HMAUV
- **View**: user interface to display data and receive commands from the user
- **Controller**: processes command data and relays such data between Model and View
- **Client/Server**: architecture between Controller and Model modules

### Ground Control System (GCS)

The GCS has seven user interface components:
- Thruster angle sliders
- Thruster RPM sliders
- Open/close gripper sliders
- Reset State button
- Command Mode dropdown
- Send Commands button
- IMU data display (acceleration and angular speed in x, y, and z directions)

### Software Operation

- Python 3.8 is required on GCS.
- Required packages: customtkinter, numpy, Pillow.
- RPi requires pymavlink, smc (currently inoperable), MAVProxy.
