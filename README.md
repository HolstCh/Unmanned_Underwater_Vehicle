# DeepFlightENEL500

This research project involves designing and implementing a software/hardware integration to provide underwater drone movement control for Unmanned Vehicles Robotarium research lab. We successfully integrated various electronic components and developed software to control the underwater drone. The project consists of a custom GUI, a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B, Pixhawk 4 autopilot, a drone prototype, and a list of other various electronic components. The projectâ€™s main objective is deploying and navigating the drone within confined underwater spaces.
